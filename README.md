#Matching Card Game

### Goal: Make a 10 card memory game - users must be able to select two cards and check if they are a match. If they are a match, they stay flipped. If not, they flip back over. Game is done when all cards are matched and flipped over.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.

## Lessons Learned:
Learned to use setTimout() to delay my function from running so that the player could see what is underneath the second card they clicked on without having the function check if they were not a match and flip the cards over super fast. Also learned how to shuffle the containers in my section howlding the different cards without changing my hard coded html by using the css property order.
